   Introduction and Overview of Tools.


.. todo::

    Need a method to test and verify configuration (e.g., encryption, decription)
    are working properly.  Can access S3, etc.
    Maybe some command-line tools to exercise the various subsystems in a
    non-destructive manner.

.. todo::

    Need some warnings about timekeeping on the primary PostgreSQL server.
    Should use NTP or something similar to maintain a relatively accurate
    timebase.

.. todo::
        
    Need some warnings about the bucket and snapshot prefix and WAL prefix 
    being unique for all databases, otherwise data will be clobbered
